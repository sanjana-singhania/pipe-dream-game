## explanation:
a simplified version of [this](https://archive.org/details/win3_PipeDr3x) game

the user is able to place pipes on the grid at the start of the game

after 5 seconds, the 'goo' starts flowing, and the player must continue to place pipes

once the goo is 'spilled', or reaches a dead end, the game ends

the objective of this game is to earn the most amount of points in the time possible
